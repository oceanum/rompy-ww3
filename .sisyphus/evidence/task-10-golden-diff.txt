GOLDEN DIFF STATUS: IDENTICAL
---
The golden namelist output from Task 3 is byte-for-byte identical to the output after all type conversions (Tasks 6-9).

This confirms:
- Date fields (Optional[datetime]) render identically to previous string-based dates
- Integer fields (Optional[int]) render identically to previous string-based integers  
- Type conversions are format-preserving as designed
- No unexpected changes in namelist rendering

Evidence: test_outputs/tp1.1/rompy_runs/ww3_tp1_1_regression/namelist matches .sisyphus/evidence/golden/ww3_tp1_1_regression.nml exactly.
