Verification run: Base uploader interface implementation

Test 1: Import base classes
Command: python -c "from src.rompy_ww3.postprocess.uploaders.base import BaseUploader, UploadResult; print('Import OK')"
Result: Import OK

Test 2: Instantiate UploadResult
Command: Create UploadResult with all fields
Result: UploadResult(success=True, message='Upload successful', bytes_uploaded=12345)
Fields validated: success=True, message='Upload successful', bytes_uploaded=12345

Test 3: Verify ABC pattern
Command: Check BaseUploader is abstract with upload() method
Result: BaseUploader is an ABC with abstractmethod upload()

Verification complete. Base uploader interface works as expected.
