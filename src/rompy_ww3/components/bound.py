class Bound(WW3ComponentBaseModel):
    """Component for ww3_bound.nml containing boundary configuration.

    The Bound component represents the boundary preprocessing configuration for WW3.
    It contains the BOUND_NML namelist object needed for configuring the WW3 boundary
    preprocessing program (ww3_bound.nml).
    
    This component manages:
    - BOUND_NML: Boundary preprocessing parameters including mode, interpolation, and verbosity
    
    The Bound component is used for boundary preprocessing runs and provides a clean interface
    for configuring all aspects of the WW3 boundary preprocessing program.
    
    Key Features:
    - **Boundary Processing**: Configuration for boundary data processing
    - **Interpolation**: Interpolation method selection for boundary data
    - **Verbosity**: Control over output verbosity during boundary processing
    - **File Handling**: Input/output file specification for boundary data
    
    Usage Examples:
        ```python
        from rompy_ww3.components import Bound
        from rompy_ww3.namelists import Bound as BoundNML
        
        # Create a boundary preprocessing configuration
        bound = Bound(
            bound=BoundNML(
                mode="READ",
                interp=2,
                verbose=1
            )
        )
        
        # Render the namelist content
        content = bound.render()
        
        # Write to a file
        bound.write_nml("./namelists")
        ```
