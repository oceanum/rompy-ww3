    """SOURCE_NML namelist for WW3.

    The SOURCE_NML namelist defines the type 3 (source terms) output configuration for point output in WAVEWATCH III.
    This namelist controls how source term information is output for specific points in the model domain.
    
    Type 3 output provides detailed information about the various source terms that contribute to
    wave growth and decay, including wind input, nonlinear wave-wave interactions, whitecapping
    dissipation, bottom friction, and ice effects. This output is valuable for process studies
    and understanding model physics.
